            </div>  
              <p>I am a Fullstack software developer, who believes in the  philosophy of life-long learning. 
                I enjoy learning new technologies and using creativity to solve complex issues. In the past five years, 
                I have been in the service industry where I have obtained a strong foundation for precision in detail and communication. 
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                When I'm not coding, you can find me reading fantasy books or switching between playing nostalgic final fantasy games to modern cute games like pokemon.
                </p>
